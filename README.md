    <h1>BouncerBot: Keeping the Party Safe üéâ</h1>
    <p>Welcome to BouncerBot, your trusty bouncer at the club, but in Discord form! If you want to ensure a secure and impostor-free environment for your server, you're in the right place. Here's a quick guide on how to set up and deploy BouncerBot.</p>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fork This Repo:</strong> Start by forking this repository to create your own copy. You'll be the manager of your exclusive club (Discord server) with BouncerBot at the door.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Your Platform:</strong> Connect your GitHub account to a service like <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> to host your bot. If you're not sure how to host a Python Discord bot on Heroku, you can easily find guides online.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a Discord Bot:</strong> Head over to the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">Discord Developer Portal</a> and create a bot. Follow the simple steps provided in the portal to set up your very own virtual bouncer.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Member Intent:</strong> In your bot settings, make sure to check the "Server Members Intent" checkbox. This enables your bot to keep an eye on new and existing members.</li>
        <li><strong>Get That Token:</strong> Under the bot tab, you'll find the magic key, your bot token. Copy it to your clipboard ‚Äì you'll need this to give your bouncer its orders.</li>
        <li><strong>Set up Environment Variables:</strong> In your chosen hosting platform (e.g., Heroku), navigate to the settings and create an environment variable named "DISCORD" (exactly as typed here). Paste your bot token as the value.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire Up the Dyna:</strong> Start up your bot, and BAM, it'll be online, guarding your server's virtual doors.</li>
    </ol>
