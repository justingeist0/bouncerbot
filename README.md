# bouncerbot
To host this fork this to create your own repository and connect to a service like https://www.heroku.com you can follow tutorials on youtube. Search how to host a discord bot. I am currently hosting it on Heroku.

Then create a discord bot in the dev portal, just google discord dev portal and follow steps their to create a bot.

Check the member intent checkbox and get the token under the bot tab. Copy it to your clipboard. 

In heroku (or whatever platform you use) go to settings to create a environment variable called DISCORD and set the value to the token.

Start up the dyna and BAM it'll be online.

You can follow along tutorials online to figure it out, but I can make a more detailed guide if you want me to, i'd make a video step by step tutorial how to host it. 

If you need help I will see your message on https://www.twitter.com/fantasmadev just hmu
