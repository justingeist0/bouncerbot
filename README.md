# bouncerbot
To host this fork this to create your own repository and connect this to a service like Heroku

Then create a discord bot in the dev portal, check the member intent checkbox and get the token

With that token create a environment variable called DISCORD and set the value to the token

I can make a more detailed guide if you want me to, i'd make a video step by step tutorial once and just send it to you, but I think most people will just copy the link because it's free

The link to invite this bot to your server is this:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1162810807730581585&permissions=2050&scope=bot
