# bouncerbot
To host the Bouncer discord bot fork this repo to create your own repository and connect your github account to a service like https://www.heroku.com. 

Searching how to host a python discord bot on heroku will show you how to do it.

Then create a discord bot in the dev portal, just google discord dev portal and follow steps there to create a bot.

Check the member intent checkbox and get the token under the bot tab. Copy it to your clipboard. 

In heroku (or whatever platform you use) go to settings to create a environment variable called DISCORD (exactly as typed there) and set the value to be the token.

Start up the dyna and BAM it'll be online.

You can just google a bunch of questions until you figure it out, but I can make a more detailed guide if you want me to, i'd make a video step by step tutorial how to host it.

If you need help I will see your message on https://www.twitter.com/fantasmadev just hmu 

The link to invite this bot to your server is below if you don't feel like hosting it:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1162810807730581585&permissions=2050&scope=bot


And if you wanna contribute just make a pull request with features! This could be a much more in depth security bot for discord. I just built the MVP for what I wanted it to do.
